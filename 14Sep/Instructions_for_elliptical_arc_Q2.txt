Instructions Regarding Execution of Q2 Program


1. You can execute as you normally execute other OpenGL Programs.
2. This Program is a bit weird when we randomly initialize the center of the arc (cx, cy) and the major axis 'rx' and minor axis 'ry'.
3. By default this program randomly initializes alpha, beta, rx, ry, cx and cy.
4. This Program shows correct behaviour only if we initialise alpha and beta using rand() function and other values such as cx, cy,
	rx, ry etc. we can keep hardcoded or take input using cin.

5. You only have to uncomment the lines 53, 54, 55. This will make center as (0, 0) and 800, 500 as major and minor axes respectively.
6. Doing the Point 5. will ensure that program shows intended behavior in all cases.
